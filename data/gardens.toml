description = """
Fearon Hall is our home, where we have our beautiful greenhouse and sheds; where we have our parties,
workshops, gatherings. We use two of the planters facing the Parish Church to grow food. Our gardens radiate
out from this centre.
We grow on two beds on Rectory Road. One is fronted by a lovely raised bed made by Glebe Workskills and paid
for by Chesterton House Financial Planning. We put it there to deter people from driving onto the garden and
squashing the plants!

The Corner Garden at the bottom of Cambridge St was our first garden.  There are 11 raised beds, the wooden ones were made from re-purposed wood by Glebe Workskills and paid for by Chesterton House Financial Planning.  There is a herb garden, a fruit garden and at most times of the year there will be vegetables to pick.  What a great community to be part of. Many people go there to enjoy the peace and to pick food and they all tell us they love what we have done.  When we started there the soil was dead, not a worm in sight.  Last year our nasturtiums were covered in caterpillars.  Yippee, more butterflies.

The front garden of 24 Limehurst Avenue is an IEL garden and plenty of neighbours go there to pick.  Just imagine if every other front garden in Loughborough were the same.  How green and joyful a town this would be.  Instead more and more people are paving over their front gardens.  Where is the wildlife supposed to live?  Let’s share our town with other living creatures.
