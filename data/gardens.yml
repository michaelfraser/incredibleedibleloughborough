  - name: Fearon Hall
    description: Fearon Hall is our home, where we have our beautiful greenhouse and
      sheds; where we have our parties, workshops, gatherings.  We grow food on
      two beds on Rectory Road.  One is fronted by a lovely raised bed made by
      Glebe House Work Skills and paid for by Chesterton House Financial
      Planning.  We put it there to deter people from driving onto the garden
      and squashing the plants!

  - name: Corner Garden
    description: "**The Corner Garden** at the bottom of Cambridge Street is where
      we started.  There are 11 raised beds, the wooden ones were made from
      re-purposed wood by Glebe House Work Skills and paid for by Chesterton
      House Financial Planning.  There are fruit bushes in the garden and at
      most times of the year there will be vegetables to pick.  What a great
      community to be part of. Many people go there to enjoy the peace and to
      pick food and they all tell us they love what we have done.  When we
      started there the soil was dead, not a worm in sight.  Last year our
      nasturtiums were covered in caterpillars.  Yippee, more butterflies!"

  - name: 24 Limehurst Avenue
    description: The front garden of **24 Limehurst Avenue** is an IEL garden and
      plenty of neighbours go there to pick.  Just imagine if every other front
      garden in Loughborough were the same.  How green and joyful a town this
      would be.  Instead, more and more people are paving over their front
      gardens.  Where is the wildlife supposed to live?  Let’s share our town
      with other living creatures.

  - name: Knightthorpe Methodist Church
    description: >
      The IEL garden in front of Knightthorpe Methodist Church has to be
      seen.  A lovely spot but also amazingly productive of healthy organic
      food, free to anyone who cares to wander in off the street and thoroughly
      enjoyed by the gardening group there.

      At Warwick Way Flats we have two raised beds and a ground level patch of
      soil. Strawberries, beans, beetroot, peas, courgettes are all likely to be
      growing there in the summer months.

    description: >
      Our small garden in Thorpe Acre Road is well known by the locals, who
      often stop and talk when we are gardening there.  And across the road from
      it there is another private front garden turned into a public source of
      organic produce.
