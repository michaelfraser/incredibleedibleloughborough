# Privacy Policy

## Who we are

This privacy notice is for Incredible Edible Loughborough (‘IEL’, ‘Company’, ‘we’, ‘us’, or ‘our’). Our website address is: {{< baseUrl >}}

## What information do we collect and process?

We do not process any sensitive information and we do not receive any information from third parties.

We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you express an interest in obtaining information about us or our activities, when you participate in activities, or otherwise when you contact us.

The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the activities, the choices you make, and how you engage with us. The personal information we collect may include the following:

Media

If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.

## How do we process your information?

We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our activities, including Processing your information to:

- Deliver activities.
- Respond to user inquiries/offer support to users.
- Send you details about our activities, changes to our terms and policies, and other similar information.

We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.

We process your information only when we have a valid legal reason to do so.

## How long do we keep your information?

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. When we have no ongoing legitimate need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

## How do we keep your information safe?

We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

## Do we collect information from minors?

We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By engaging in our activities, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s engagement in activities. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at {{< emailAddress >}}

## What are your privacy rights?

You have the right to ask us for copies of your personal information, to rectify information you think is inaccurate or incomplete, to erase your personal information, and to object to any processing if we are able to process your information.

## Withdrawing your consent

If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.

However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

There are occasions when it is possible that a photo or video may be captured. Images in which people can be identified are a form of personal data which is protected by data protection legislation. Please see our Photos and Filming Guidance for information on how you can exercise your rights to be excluded from any image capture.

## How do you exercise your rights

Please contact us if possible by email or making your request known in writing. At any IEL event where information is being requested speak to the IEL organisers. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

## Opting out of marketing and promotional communications

You can unsubscribe from our promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us. You will then be removed from the appropriate lists. However, we may still communicate with you, for example, to send you activity-related messages that are necessary to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.

If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at {{< emailAddress >}}
