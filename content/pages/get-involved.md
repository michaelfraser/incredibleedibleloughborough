## Get Involved

### Our food system is broken and unfair. You can become a change maker.

Are you bothered by how much pesticide you might be eating in your daily fruit and veg?  Does it bother you that food we used to grow right here is now imported hundreds of miles, ramping up the floods and fires caused by climate change?  Healthy food is unaffordable while supermarkets make vast profits from promotions and price cuts on junk food.  Over 10% of the population can’t afford to eat properly and bad food is making us a sick nation.  

### We don’t have to put up with this.  
Together we can make change.  We can become self reliant.  We can make food local, healthy and cheap by getting together and growing it here, where we are, on our doorsteps, on unused, neglected spaces.  And we don’t have to wait three years for an allotment, there is plenty of spare land in the town.  Ordinary people acting together can create radical change.  

### Join our gardening sessions  
Anyone can join us and learn to grow organic, healthy fruit and vegetables.  Starting in March in our greenhouse at Fearon Hall, we teach how to sow seeds for summer and autumn crops and plant them out in our Incredible gardens for the community.  We give hands on experience of maintaining the crops right through to harvest. What’s more you’ll have fun making friends and working with others to produce healthy food available to all.  Join us by emailing ediblelboro@gmail.com and become a change maker today.
