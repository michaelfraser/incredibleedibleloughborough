# About us

Incredible Edible grows food in urban settings, open to the public.  The organisation started in 2008 and in Loughborough we started in 2022. We now have seven gardens growing fruit and veg throughout the year.  Unlike other community gardens they are always open to walk in and help yourself to free food. 

Our aim is to transform our urban landscape by creating a culture of local food growing, which will bring people together and restore wildlife.  We are a really friendly bunch of about 30 members, who believe in coffee, cake and chat as well as hard work, and a large number of supporters and followers.  Anyone can learn to grow food with us through hands on experience and workshops, free of charge.  This is a community project for improving mental and physical wellbeing, reducing the carbon footprint of our food, and making Loughborough’s green spaces better for wildlife. 
We believe that to plant a seed is to plant a promise.  And we have lots of fun along the way.
