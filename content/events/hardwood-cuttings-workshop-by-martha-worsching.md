# Hardwood Cuttings Workshop by Martha Worsching

10/01/2026 at Fearon Hall

Hardwood cuttings are best taken at the time when plants are dormant, i.e. between November and February/March. The following plants are ideal for propagating at this time of year: bay, currant black/red/white, fig, forsythia, gooseberry, grape vine, roses, hawthorn, hazel.

This is a hands-on workshop in which Martha Worsching demonstrates how to propagate plants from cuttings.  If participants would like to bring cuttings material from their own plants, please bring some hard stems that haven’t flowered this year, about pencil-thick and 30-40 cm long.  There will also be plenty cuttings to take home for everyone.
