description: Get the full picture of what we've been doing and what we will be
  doing in the near future.

Our formal business meeting looking at the annual report and accounts, documents sent to members in advance.

We'll have a round-up of news from different groups and a summary of our strategic plans for 2026.  

There'll be time for everyone to contribute ideas and opinions.

Refreshments are available.

Following the business meeting Gisela will give a presentation on her project with the Gaia Foundation in collaboration with IEL in 2025.

IEL is now a big project and people tend to know small parts of it.  This is a good chance to get the full picture of what we've been doing and what we will be doing in the near future.
