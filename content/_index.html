            Our aim is to transform our urban landscape by creating a culture of local food growing, which will bring
            people
            together and restore wildlife. We are a really friendly bunch of about 30 members, who believe in coffee,
            cake and
            chat as well as hard work, and a large number of supporters and followers. Anyone can learn to grow food
            with us
            through hands on experience and workshops, free of charge. This is a community project for improving mental
            and
            physical wellbeing, reducing the carbon footprint of our food, and making Loughborough's green spaces better
            for
            wildlife.

            We believe that to plant a seed is to plant a promise. And we have lots of fun along the way.
